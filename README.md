# Seabird Avoidance Rates for Collisison Risk Modelling ü¶Öüéè

## Summary üìä
Code and data to calculate seabird avoidance rates for collision risk modelling. This uses data on direct bird collisons and passage rates from numerous onshore windfarms and the Thanet offshore wind farm to calcualte a value for meso and micro-scale avioidacne combined. This work builds on the avoidance rates calculated in [Cook (2021)](https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/publications/bto_rr_739_cook_collision_risk_models_final_web.pdf) and updates the reccomended avoidance rates for the UK seabirds. The avoidance rates we reccomend are located in the folder `SuggestedARs/` but note that these will differ slightly from those generated by running the analysis with the code and data provoded here since data from a single windfarm was removed due to data permissions.

## Code description
- `Ozsanlav-Harris et al (2022) markdown code.rmd` Markdown file to calculate avoidance rates using four different collisions risk models; Basic Band, Extended Band, Stochastic Basic Band and Stochastic Extended Band

## Data description 
- `Ozsanlav-Harris et al (2022) Collision Data.csv` main data file containing the number of collisions, correction factors, pasage rates and monitoring periods for each windfarm included in the analysis
- `Flight Height Data.csv` proportion of birds flying at various heights for a given species. Each row in that data set represents the proportion of birds flying within a 1m interval. I.e. row 54 gives the proportion of birds for a given species flying between 53m and 54m.
- `BH_Boot.csv` Black-headed Gull bootstrapped flight heights
- `CG_Boot.csv` Common Gull bootstrapped flight heights
- `CT_Boot.csv` Common Tern bootstrapped flight heights
- `GB_Boot.csv` Great Black-backed Gull bootstrapped flight heights
- `HG_Boot.csv` Herring Gull bootstrapped flight heights
- `KI_Boot.csv` Kittiwake bootstrapped flight heights
- `LB_Boot.csv` Lesser Black-backed Gull bootstrapped flight heights
- `LG_Boot.csv` Little Gull bootstrapped flight heights
- `NE_Boot.csv` Sandwich Tern bootstrapped flight heights

## Output description
- `SuggestedARs/BasicBandAR_ table.png` Reccomended basic Band avoidance rates 
- `SuggestedARs/StBasicBandAR_ table.png` Reccomended stochastic basic Band avoidance rates
