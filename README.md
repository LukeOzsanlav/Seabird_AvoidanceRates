# Seabird Avoidance Rates
Code and data to calculate seabird avoidance rates for collision risk modelling. This uses data from observed collisons from numerous onshore windfarms and the Thanet offshore wind farm. This work built on the avoidacne rates calculated in [Cook (2021)(https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/publications/bto_rr_739_cook_collision_risk_models_final_web.pdf)
